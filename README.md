EICAR File Generator as a Blazor (C#) Web App

The idea behind this came up when testing whether or not an AV would alert on a file.  Not wanting to use real malicious files, this was born.  As time has gone on, I have added more and more file types to the list, while also updating the "squirelly-ness" of the files as AV's have gotten "smarter" about false positives.
